# Belize Solar Project Journal 

## Week of 2-05-18

This past week I worked with Jensen and Kara on a presentation going over the outline, project components, and specific tasks. We presented to the class and fielded suggestions from our classmates. These suggestions are available on Google Docs.

### 2-07-18

Met with Professor Skon to discuss data analysis prospects:
Big Ideas:
-Cost Analysis
	-Missing data (optimistic vs pessimistic)
	-Pessimistic: Assume every time data is missing, the solar panel is not functioning (gap is not due to network failure)
-Determine what people want to see to inform data analytics
-Modeling efficiency(?)
	-Different ways the efficiency can change
		-Corrosion
		-Dirt
	-Resistance change effect on efficiency


Logistics:
-Language choice:
	-Rank language preferences individually, then compare
	-C++ standard template library
