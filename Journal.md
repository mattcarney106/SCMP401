# Belize Solar Project Journal 

## Week of 2-05-18

This past week I worked with Jensen and Kara on a presentation going over the outline, project components, and specific tasks. We presented to the class and fielded suggestions from our classmates. These suggestions are available on Google Docs.

### 2-07-18

Met with Professor Skon to discuss data analysis prospects:
Big Ideas:
1. Cost Analysis

   *Missing data (optimistic vs pessimistic)
   *Pessimistic: Assume every time data is missing, the solar panel is not functioning (gap is not due to network failure)
   *Determine what people want to see to inform data analytics
   *Modeling efficiency(?)

   *Different ways the efficiency can change
   *Corrosion
   *Dirt
   *Resistance change effect on efficiency


Logistics:

*Language choice:

*Rank language preferences individually, then compare
*C++ standard template library
