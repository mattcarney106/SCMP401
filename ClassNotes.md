# Class notes for SCMP 401

## 2-12-18
Presentors this week:

* Doni  
* Miku  
* Tudor

###Doni's Update
Rotary encoders:

* Incrementing  
* Optical

Interrupt function:

* Accounts for high rate of rotation
* Arduino does **not** have a high enough sample rate to accurately record data
* Possible solutions:
 * Change prescaler (?)
 * Planetary gear
 * Use a different arduino (Due)
 * Use a different rotary encoder
 * Suggestions from the class?
 
General Usage:

 * Coach enters email for output (on Raspberry Pi)
 * Swimmer decides to save or not save
 * If save, swimmer enters name, etc.
 * Suggestions:
  * Save options after swim?
  * Barcode tattoos
  * Facial recognition software

###Tudor's Update
Bootstrapping:

* For use when certain statistical tests rely on assumptions that break down
* Tudor's example:
 * Histogramming required GPA's for law schools
 * Current bootstrapping packages do not have intuitive output, not ideal for beginners
* Current research:
 * bootstrap, one-sample statistic
 * StatKey for comparisons, use as a check
* Questions:
 * Usability
* Suggestions:
 * Take survey to gauge usability
 
###Miku's Update

Updates:

* Test workflow
* 19 fields
 * Would like to remove multiple age of child fields

Going forward:

* Distribution of customers on different days
* Date may be enough

### Kara's update

Background:

 * MySQL subtabling
 
What's been done:

 * Looking at database fields
 * Methods of access

 
Accessing the database:

 * Need to access cs3 kenyon server through cslab server
 * Adapting old SQL queries to practice (originally written in PHP)
 * Four relevant fields:
   * IID - bank ID
   * QID - Units of response
   * TimeStamp: Time recorded
 * Writing C++ program to access database
   * Problems with data type matching

Next steps:

 * Create summary tables
   * Site table, bank table
   * Will speed up querying
 * Finish up back-end functions
 * Caching if time permits (?)

Potential issues:

 * Solar data is sharing location with irrelevant information from unrelated project
 * Incorporating a variety of different languages together
   * Translating PHP functions to C++

   
   
### Sam's update

Demonstration of etherium network:

* Job posting w/ etherium
* Life lottery etherium lottery
* CryptoKitties: cats with etherium 

Programming a smart contract:

* Need Geth 
* Private blockchain (public is expensive)
* IDE for smart contract programming (Remix)
* Cost associated with storing information on Etherium network
* Machine code operations measured in Gas

## 2-26-18

### Jensen's Update

* Problems with current webpage  
* Tableau may not work

* Need to strip the website, can't reuse code
* Use JSON to generate fake data

### Bennet's Update

## 3-19-18

### Doni's Update

* Recap: using arduinos and raspberry pis to automate power rack data acquisition
* Old problems (solved): Rotary encoder too sensitive, arduino Uno can't record fast enough
* New problems: Due can't take more than 3.3V
* Added small 4 digit display LED 
* Communication btw Raspberry Pi and Arduino

Raspberry Pi:

* Wifi capable
* Trouble with packages

New project pipeline:

* Rackbot -> Arduino (as receiver) -> Raspberry Pi

### Coire's Update

* Gas chromatography
* separates components of compound in question
* Use analog-digital converter to Raspberry Pi to digitize
* Visualize data in real time
* Email data vs. set up a website
* Hardware taking longer than expected
* Code for the future:
 * Convert A to D  
 * Perform data integration (?)
 * Store data on RP

### Tudor's Update

* Problem: Bootstrapping difficult to use w/o statistical experience  
* Last time: implemented crude version of boostrap
* 3 types: standard, percentile method, reversing percentiles

### Google article

* Why diff btw products?  
* How often does this happen?
* Is this censorship  
* Why didn't/couldn't google retrain it?


## 3-26-18

### Bennet's Update

* Last time: finished tutorials, wanted to create simple version of simulation, create web interface
* Current simulation outputs wealth vs time for many trials
* Parameters: initial wealth, withdraw rate, deposit rate, random shock
* Problem displaying results of simulation on website

### Kara's Update

* queries for visualization almost done
* new sites added, formatted query output to xml
* Two classes: site and sites
  * site: contains all information for specific site
  * sites: contains vector of all individual sites
* What's next: fix redundant database access calls
* make new function that connects
