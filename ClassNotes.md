# Class notes for SCMP 401

## 2-12-18
Presentors this week:

* Doni  
* Miku  
* Tudor

###Doni's Update
Rotary encoders:

* Incrementing  
* Optical

Interrupt function:

* Accounts for high rate of rotation
* Arduino does **not** have a high enough sample rate to accurately record data
* Possible solutions:
 * Change prescaler (?)
 * Planetary gear
 * Use a different arduino (Due)
 * Use a different rotary encoder
 * Suggestions from the class?
 
General Usage:

 * Coach enters email for output (on Raspberry Pi)
 * Swimmer decides to save or not save
 * If save, swimmer enters name, etc.
 * Suggestions:
  * Save options after swim?
  * Barcode tattoos
  * Facial recognition software

###Tudor's Update
Bootstrapping:

* For use when certain statistical tests rely on assumptions that break down
* Tudor's example:
 * Histogramming required GPA's for law schools
 * Current bootstrapping packages do not have intuitive output, not ideal for beginners
* Current research:
 * bootstrap, one-sample statistic
 * StatKey for comparisons, use as a check
* Questions:
 * Usability
* Suggestions:
 * Take survey to gauge usability
 
###Miku's Update

Updates:

* Test workflow
* 19 fields
 * Would like to remove multiple age of child fields

Going forward:

* Distribution of customers on different days
* Date may be enough
