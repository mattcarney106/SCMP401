Over the past week, we've made significant progress in defining my goals and expectations for the project as well as determining potential pitfalls and challenges. This has made me more aware of my ability to create a realistic, creative vision for a project without predetermined guidelines. 

After meeting with Professor Skon the first time, I started to feel a little overwhelmed with the project. The lack of structure seemed like a burden to me. As the week progressed, however, I started to come up with some ideas for analyses and ways in which the data could be used to highlight some of the benefits of solar panels. Additionally, I came up with the idea to model the efficiency of the solar panels, which led to a discussion in my second meeting with Professor Skon about how such a model could help to characterize the solar panels' operations. After this brainstorming, the open-endedness of the project felt less like a burden and more like an opportunity. This is because I switched from a mindset focused on fear of failure to one of potential for success.

Once it was time to present what we had in store for the project, I felt like I had a much more comprehensive idea of what the project was going to look like. I was happy with my presenting skills and how well I kept larger goals for the project in mind while discussing the individual components. Specifically, I used transitions to and from my partners' sections to motivate my section of the project and my partner's section of the project. 

Finally, I realized during my research this week how my physics background would help me and my partners to understand some of the finer points of the project.
